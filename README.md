   # Troubleshooting
   
   In case a Tomcat will give you a warning like org.apache.catalina.webresources.Cache.getResource Unable to add the resource ... to the cache because there was insufficient free space
   
   Please, In your $CATALINA_BASE/conf/context.xml add block before </Context>
   
   &lt;Resources cachingAllowed="true" cacheMaxSize="100000" /&gt;
